==============================
Copyright (c) 2017 Daniel <https://github.com/danielmeek32>

Version: 1.0 Alpha


Adds wolves to Minetest (requires Animals mod available from https://github.com/danielmeek32/animals).

Wolves spawn on snow.
Untamed wolves remain for 7 1/2 minutes before despawning.
Wolves will follow players holding flesh or cooked meat.
Wolves can be tamed by feeding them flesh or cooked meat.
Wolves cannot be bred.

Wolves do not drop anything when killed.
Tamed wolves cannot be killed.

Tamed wolves will attempt to remain in the area around their owner.
If their owner is close by, they will wander around, returning towards their owner if they or their owner gets too far away.
If their owner is a long distance away or cannot be found, they will sit down.

Tamed wolves can be instructed to sit down by right-clicking on them.
When sitting, tamed wolves will not move until they are instructed to stand up by right-clicking on them or until their owner holds flesh or cooked meat nearby.
